## Load a .bak file into the MySQL 
- .bak file is a backup of the data. It cannot be directly imported into the MySQL
- **Preparations:** 
   1) Intall the SQL Server and MySQL
   

- **Steps:**
   A detailed tutorial for the data migration from SQL Server to MySQL: 
   https://mysqlworkbench.org/2012/07/migrating-from-ms-sql-server-to-mysql-using-workbench-migration-wizard/ 
   
- **Important settings:** 
   1) Set up the as username and password in SQL Server
      - Secruity --> Logins --> Right click sa properties
      - Reset the password
      - Click Status tabï¼š Set "Permission to connect to database engine" --> "Grant" and "Login" --> "Enabled"
      - Right click server properties: Set "Server authentication" --> "SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode" and "Login auditing" --> "Successful logins only"
   
   2) In SQL Server Configuration manager 
      - In "SQL Server Network Configuration" --> "protocols for MSSQLSERVER", set TCP/IP as enabled
      - Right Click the TCP/IP properties --> Check the IP address, the TCP port in IPAll is set as '1433'
      - In "SQL Server Services", ensure the instances have the running state
   
   3) Firewall settings: allow SQL server to communicate through windows defender firewall
      - Open windows defender firewall, add "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn\sqlservr.exe"
   
   4) Restart the SQL Server using services.msc
   
   5) Fix the error "SQL Server does not exist or access denied Fixed" --> Create alias on client side
      Reason: The server name has not been set up as the alias for the IP address
      - Search for 'cliconfg.exe'
      - Create TCP/IP alias --> Enable the TCP/IP and make sure there is no Named Piped in the list (right side)
      - Click Alias tab, fill in server alias, choose TCP/IP Network libraries, and fill in SQL Server IP in Server name
      - Now the remote server can be connected by server name
