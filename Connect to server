Method1:

1. Install Anaconda:

   wget http://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

   bash Anaconda3-4.0.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

2. Anaconda has been installed in the server with pkgs. However, the default python version is in /usr/bin/python.

　 Command "which python" could check which python we are using 

2. Set the environment variable

　　1) vim ~/.bash_profile (or ~/.bashrc)

　　2) Add export PATH="/opt/Anaconda2/bin:$PATH" in the end of .bashrc

　　3) source ~/.bash_profile

3. Check the added path

　　echo $PATH

　　/opt/Anaconda2/bin has been added into the front of the PATH

　　* folder in front of the PATH would be taken as the default version

Method2:

alias python='/opt/Anaconda2/bin/python2.7'

 

Cause of error:

1) Lost of a '/' in front of the path -- '/opt/Anaconda2/bin'

2) Wrongly spelled Anaconda2

 

Questons:

1) Difference between ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile

 

Jypyter notebook on server：

2. Start server

3. jupyter notebook

4. Visit the server by: http://localhost:3129
